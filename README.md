## BASIC ROADMAP:
| NEW STUFF : [ x ] - in progress, [ ok ] done                  | Description                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [ x ] PDF and XSLX reports                                    | New reporting formats                                                                                       |
| [ x ] Activity detected statistic                             | 'Detect' user activity - it could be useful when we need to determine if the sandboxes are in use or fuzzes |
| [ x ] Fixed statistics in dashboard and campaign              | I don't know who did this shit, but it's fixed now. During campaign it's more useful                        |
| [ x ] Some changes to be pain in the ass for the boys in blue | Changed headers, added new error log, added parameters, etc                                                 |
| [ x ] evil ngnix                                              | :) long term                                                                                                |
| [ x ] Smishing                                                | :) long term                                                                                                         |
